To create the corresponding C function that places a call — i.e., to construct and broadcast a Bitcoin transaction that acts as a child of a known parent TX and carries data bytes on-chain — you'll be building and pushing a transaction with a specific input (parent TX) and a crafted OP_RETURN or output that encodes your VoBTC packet.

Let’s assume:

You’re using Bitcoin Core (bitcoind) for relay.

You want to broadcast a transaction from C via RPC or raw hex.

You want to embed arbitrary voice or signaling bytes in the output.

✅ Requirements
Parent transaction ID + vout (so we can spend it).

A key (private WIF or hex key) to sign the TX.

Destination address (optional, for actual payment).

Data payload (e.g. encoded VoIP bytes).

A way to push the final transaction (via bitcoin-cli or RPC).

✅ Approach
We'll:

Create a raw transaction.

Insert the OP_RETURN or script payload.

Sign it.

Broadcast it.

---------------------------------------------

int main() {
    const char *parent_txid = "abcd1234..."; // TXID you're spending from
    int vout = 0;                            // Output index
    const char *dest_address = "";          // Optional
    unsigned char payload[] = "hello-vobtc"; // Your signaling or voice data

    place_call(parent_txid, vout, dest_address, payload, sizeof(payload) - 1);
    return 0;
}
